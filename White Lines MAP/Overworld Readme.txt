Hi there, and thank you for downloading the LoBit Overworld tileset!

This tileset is intended to be used in a tile based level editor, 
I recommend Tiled (https://www.mapeditor.org) which is free and good.

For best results I recommend making good use of the layers functionality
in the tiled app.

I stack them like so (from top to bottom):


* Cheat layer - Keep a spare layer for if you need to stick something on top.
* Map markers
* Bridges
* Roads and trails
* Foliage
* Water features
* Hills and mountains
* Base layer - put flat base colors here

The darker versions of the hills and mountains are designed to go underneath the road layer,
this will really help the road pop, without losing all the terrain information.

When you are happy with your map, and want to export it for use in your
virtual tabletop of choice, follow these steps in tiled for best results:

1. Zoom in to 400%
2. File -> Export as Image
3. tick the boxes marked "Only include visible layers" and "Use current zoom level"
4. Import the image into your VTT and set the grid size to 64.

If you want you could do 800% and 128 grid size.

Be sure to tweet your creations @HelicityBoson or toot (I think that's the term) @helicity@mastodon.world

have fun!
